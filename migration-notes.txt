MIGRATION NOTES

1) Pull down the repository.
2) Needed untracked files:
	- /ConnectionStrings.config 


------------------------
ConnectionStrings.config
------------------------
	This is what I did (not nessesarily proper practice or whatever)
	The connection strings are using windows auth so I didn't really need to abstract them to their own file, but I did cause yeah. So here is the file contents.



	===========================START FILE CONTENTS
	<connectionStrings>
	  <!--<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=127.0.0.1;initial Catalog=AwfulInputs;User ID=awful_inputs_app;Password=awful_inputs_app" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />-->
	  <add name="MigrationConnection" connectionString="Data Source=127.0.0.1;Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=true" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	  <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=127.0.0.1;Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=true" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	</connectionStrings>
	===========================END FILE CONTENTS

	SQL server might not be configured right if it is new. You might have to do this.
	Open sql server configuration manager and under Sql server network configuration enable named pipes and tcp\ip
	You may need to restart the service.
	I had to restart my computer.
	Then you can run the migration and it should work! (/migration)
